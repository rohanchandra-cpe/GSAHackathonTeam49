The MyPlate.gov website includes recommendations for food and beverage choices based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The amount of dairy foods children need each day depends on their age and can vary between 1 2/3 to 2 cups for toddlers under 2, 2 to 2 Â½ cups for children ages 2-8, and 3 cups for children and adolescents 9-18. Find the right amount for you by getting your MyPlate Plan. For children under age 2 years, dairy such as yogurt and cheese, including soy-based yogurt, can be introduced starting around 6 months. However, infants should not consume cow milk, as a beverage, or fortified soy beverage, before age 12 months as a replacement for human milk or infant formula. Plain cow (whole) milk or fortified unsweetened soy beverage can be offered beginning around 12 months of age to help meet calcium, potassium, vitamin D and protein needs.

Consumption of dairy is especially critical during childhood and adolescence as the gap between current and recommended intakes of dairy foods widens. For children ages 2 through 18, nutrient-dense options within the dairy group include unsweetened fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified soy beverages and yogurt, and low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products.
